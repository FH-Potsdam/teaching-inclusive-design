In this video i will explain you how to set up 
a new project. To do so, open the repository you  

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.080
downloaded from github: "learning parametric 
design". Inside you will find two folders:  

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.640
"code" and "lectures". "lectures" holds all the 
code examples from these videos, as well as the  

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.120
website. Inside "code" you can set up your own 
projects. To do so, simply copy the "example"  

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:38.880
folder, paste it inside the "code" folder, give it 
a nice name. Don't use any special letters or any  

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.080
spaces inside your names, otherwise you might run 
into trouble opening it in the browser later on.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.640
And if you go inside your new project folder, you 
will find two files. The first file index.html.  

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.240
This is the HTML file we will open in the browser. 
This holds the commands to load the p5.js library,  

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.920
to load an additional plugin for p5.js, which 
allows us to export vector graphics later on,  

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.000
as well as the sketch.js file. And the sketch.js 
file is the file we are going to write our own  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.560
code in. And this is the second file 
in the folder, the sketch.js file.  

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.320
And here we will write our own commands to create 
our graphics. To get a preview of how this looks  

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.480
in the browser, we can simply click on the HTML 
file again, then click on the "go live". "go live"  

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.760
is the extension we installed in the last video. 
And now you should get a new tab in your browser,  

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.080
with the result from the sketch.js file. And 
the nice thing about the live extension is,  

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.080
that this extension is monitoring our files 
and as soon as we save a file, it recognizes  

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.120
this and reloads the website for us. So if i 
change the background color here. for example

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.840
and save the file. We see that the 
website is automatically updated.
