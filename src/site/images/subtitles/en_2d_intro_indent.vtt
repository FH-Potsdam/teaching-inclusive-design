If you look at the sketch.js file, you might 
have noticed that the lines are differently  

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.360
indented. The idea behind indenting code, is to 
make it more organized and neat. So you can more  

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.280
easily navigate your code later on. In JavaScript, 
this does not have an effect on the output of your  

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.840
code. But there's other coding languages, like 
python for example, where it's extremely important  

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.640
to correctly indent your code. So i strongly 
advise you to also use this feature, to structure  

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.680
your code. The idea behind indenting code is that 
every time, something is nested inside something  

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.320
else, you indent it one level. In this case for 
example, you have the drawing function and the  

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.760
background command is inside the drawing function, 
so you indent it once. If you would have a loop  

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.480
for example inside the draw function and another 
command inside the loop you would indent it again.
