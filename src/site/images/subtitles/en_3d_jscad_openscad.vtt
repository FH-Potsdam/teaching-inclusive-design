Many of you have probably already used some 
kind of 3D design application, like blender  

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.600
or fusion 360. The software i'm going to show you 
now, OpenSCAD a free and open software, is quite  

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.560
different to these kind of applications. Because 
this is not built to create great renderings of  

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.240
3D objects, but in contrast, this one is built to 
allow you to generate 3D objects through code. You  

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.160
can write text to generate 3D objects. And this 
is really nice to create reusable code to generate  

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.480
objects. And the objects that we are generating 
here they are really well constructed 3D objects  

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.560
that we can for example use in fabrication 
processes like 3D printing or CNC machines.  

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.040
So how do we do it in this application. We have on 
the left side an editor and on the right side we  

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.720
get a preview of the 3D objects we construct. 
And the coding is very very similar to how we  

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.840
developed our objects in p5.js. I will show you 
this application now and then we will switch to  

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.160
OpenJSCAD a JS port of the OpenSCAD language. You 
have to keep in mind if you're creating really  

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.480
really really complex 3D objects, you might 
want to switch to the OpenSCAD application,  

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.320
because it's a lot more powerful, because the 
JavaScript variant relies on the performance  

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.000
of your browser and is thereby a little bit 
limited to how complex your objects can become.  

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.840
But for now, we will use the JavaScript version. 
As we can use our same development environment  

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.280
and we don't need to learn anything new. 
I will just show you a very quick example  

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:59.680
of how to use the OpenSCAD software. Here in 
the code editor we can now create objects. For  

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.240
example i could create a simple square. Click on 
the preview button and immediately get a preview  

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.720
of a square. And now similar to how we use p5.js 
we can chain different commands to one another,  

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.120
to modify the objects we create. For example we 
could use a translate function to move our object,  

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.960
similar to how we did it in p5.js. You can now see 
how it's moving around in the coordinate system.  

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.840
We could use an extrude 
function, to extrude our object.  

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.560
Let's say we want to extrude it to the 
height 3, get a preview and see now,  

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.840
how it's being extruded in one direction. Or give 
it a different color by using the color command.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.200
It's actually quite similar from the command 
structure to p5.js. The only difference is  

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.080
that we're kind of, at least from my 
perspective, we're chaining commands in  

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.120
reverse. We start at the end, we have the actual 
object and then we're going kind of backwards,  

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.880
applying different other commands to the 
initial object that we created. We have  

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.760
the square, then we translate it, then we 
extrude it and then we give it a color,  

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.040
which is kind of the other way around 
of how you would might think about it.
