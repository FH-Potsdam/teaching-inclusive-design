00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.160
I am a hearing

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.240
person who has a professorship at the TU Vienna.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.320
On the topic of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.560
critical access in body computing.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.160
I was allowed to give myself the name, so it was a bit late

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.080
.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.080
But fundamentally, I'm interested

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.640
in how disabled people can use technology to exercise more self-determination.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.000
Because it is often the case that in the area of ​​disability,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.280
technologies are used primarily

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.480
to fix supposed errors

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.520
or to somehow assume that everything always

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000
has a certain purpose to make a disability invisible.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I would like to see how this can be designed in such a way

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.000
that people with their disabilities can use technologies together, so to speak,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.200
and do so in a self-determined manner and have choices and also

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.760
have fun while having fun in the area of ​​disability.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720
This is the term accessibility.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.760
I mean, Brain translated obviously means accessibility.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.760
So, um,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm having a bit of a hard time with it, because for me it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.160
's often thought out in terms of how it's implemented in practice.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.040
So that's why I always prefer to think about access, i.e. access in general.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560
So that's already history,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.520
that you think about how this access is created,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.080
what does it look like from the beginning and not only

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.920
how can you now

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.520
somehow make accessible , so to speak, what you didn't previously think about through the access lens

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520
for the people that you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.880
didn't think about in advance, but that you put forward

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.360
and think about, what access is there, what is needed and what isn't?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.960
And to do so openly and transparently.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.200
Simply because it is not always necessary

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.680
to make everything accessible to everyone.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440
But be aware that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.960
something shouldn't always only be accessible

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.400
to the same groups of people

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.640
. And there are certainly things where it is.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.320
I am reporting divergence myself.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.280
There are certainly things

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.000
that I prefer to do, for example, and that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.120
are typical of new things that are not interesting to a person at all

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.840
and that's okay.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.840
So not everyone has to like everything or do everything,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.640
but it should be clear that there are games.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.080
For example, if we stick with fun,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.440
divergent people are allowed to play for fun

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.080
and not just because it helps them concentrate better.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.120
This is very questionable, but that you actually think

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.640
about what, what is happening and how is access provided?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.800
But from the outset and then also on a structural level.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.200
Who is access typically there for and who is it not for?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.040
And then you always quickly realize that sometimes this isn't the case

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.240
at all, that this accessibility

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.360
is often only placed on one track,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.800
namely what

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.840
the majority of society usually finds desirable .

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.200
So it's about

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.480
accessibility, for example in the deaf area,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.240
for connoisseurs of music, so that these tags are presented in some way or

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.560
an attempt is made to switch them to vibrations or to represent them visually in some way.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.600
But actually

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600
maybe for deaf people, I mean, you know yourself better now,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.040
but actually for deaf people it might not be that interesting,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.520
it's more about that. I don't know.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.840
So I mean, I'm the worst person to ask, but

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.440
then it's more about how can you, for example,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.480
share visually binary children well on social media platforms or what do I know.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.560
So maybe our interests lie

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.240
somewhere else and then we are always presented with accessibility,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.480
which also

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.360
includes a standard desire, so to speak.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.800
So that's the desirable thing that people should want, while

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.720
on the other hand, something

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.960
that might actually be wanted is somehow completely ignored

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040
and that's why it's more like this access lens.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.680
If we.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.040
When I think about access, then it's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.200
okay for music to use this and that or

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600
Now I can of course implement this in other modalities,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.640
but then this and that are the basis.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.320
But then I can also think about it here at this level

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.320
: what are the accesses that are needed here?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.520
And maybe it's a format

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.440
that doesn't work so well for blind people. But maybe it's okay then.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.960
It is clear, but

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.400
first and foremost it is important not to set the goal so high,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.760
because it will always

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.600
be quite impossible to somehow fully participate.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.080
Um, what's somehow relevant for me in this context is

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.640
that you think about what are the limitations of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640
what are my capacities, for example who can I take with me now

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.840
? For example, it's definitely the case, Before I learned sign language,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.800
I

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.600
kind of thought like, oh yeah,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.400
I can somehow communicate with people

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.560
and then there are interpreters or something like that, yeah,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.040
so there's often a hubris

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.240
in which you... then in Only becomes aware afterwards.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.680
That's why I always think it's a good idea

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.680
not to set the approach so high, but rather to know

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.920
a little bit that there are simply limits.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.080
Yes, it will also, for example, I am now here in Vienna, in Austria,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080
that is.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.200
Social mixing based on skin color

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.440
simply doesn't exist here.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.480
This means that I will

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.560
work primarily with white people and therefore my work is

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.080
limited in its relevance to certain population groups, regardless of what they are.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.840
Um, and I think that's important,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.720
just to know

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.320
that you're

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.960
not speaking for a generality, but for a specificity.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.800
And then I think it's okay.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.240
So that

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240
's actually my main motivation as to why I'm now doing research

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.360
in a targeted manner ,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.720
because it brings people into the scientific community

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.800
who would otherwise be structurally kept out.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.640
When educational situations are bad because it often fails beforehand.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.400
So it's the system, not the people.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.680
Very little important, but that's why I like working

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.160
participatory, because it gets people involved.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And I think it's very, very important, or my experience

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.240
, that you allow

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.280
things to not happen the way you imagine them,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.640
so that you're somehow open

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.680
to the fact that things happen completely, completely differently and not so

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.080
and I think it puts a framework on it, because otherwise you can save yourself the trouble,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.440
because then you would have said beforehand, in a very nasty way,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.000
that there are such participatory design projects where somehow

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.720
a prototype is developed

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920
and then it can participation then decide, whether you're red or purple

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.760
and then I'm just like that, yes, it's certainly kind of nice

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.880
for the feeling and stuff, but for me that's not participation,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.320
I want to give the space, so to speak, where people can start to say

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.480
that We don't need it,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.720
but we would rather do that and then go with them, can.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.160
So I've actually tried this

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.240
out for very different things.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.600
I have written several literature, reviews or analyzes

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.360
on how different technologies carry such applicist ideologies.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.360
Now as a whole, not necessarily now that individually

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400
there would be a lot of abolism.
But I already briefly mentioned

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.360
the way the technological landscape is shaping up in certain areas.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.960
But, for example, there is divergence in the area of ​​neuro.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.200
If you look at which games are researched

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.680
or how games are researched when it comes to divergence, it's

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.760
93 percent of the time, to be exact,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.920
um, so there's always some sort of external purpose.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.360
Then it's about therapy,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.280
learning social skills, although social skills are also limited

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.960
to what typical people imagine social interaction to be.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.160
And there are definitely different ways of being social with each other,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.040
especially for autistic people or

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.080
people or people with ADHD, who are just a little different.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.880
But that's not talked about.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.560
Social is always very limited

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.960
or just actually learn any skills and then stop.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.840
So in this area, for example, this rhetoric is taken from a game

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.920
and actually switched to something else

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.680
where it's about doing something different with it.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.040
It's not about this pleasure being taken away

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.800
in order to subordinate it to another purpose and I find that difficult

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.240
for others.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.760
People are allowed to play to have fun, but people

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.440
who know people have to play

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.600
to learn something or to be good

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.080
at something or to be successful in therapy, i.e. to learn social skills.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.880
And that's exactly how it turns out when you look at

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.080
how they are played. What the settings become.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.360
Firstly, a lot of them are

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360
single-player games, which I find particularly funny

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.560
when it comes to social skills.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.120
So yeah, okay, then I'll just learn it on my own.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.480
Okay, sort of.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.360
So it's a little poor,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.720
um, but also

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.120
just this, this aspect of having to play,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.600
so these are things

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.040
that are played at school, a lot of

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.920
that is in focus. Ah, for children,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.000
because all of us adults apparently don't go out.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.600
Steep thesis, but.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.680
Well, they are always determined by others.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.160
So other people decide whether you play it or not.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.880
So there is neither fun nor any kind of self-determination involved.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.840
And I find that exciting

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.680
because this self-determination theory

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.080
is actually just a scientific term, but these self-determination theories

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.240
actually have a lot of influence on how we analyze games

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.240
and how we understand more positive gaming experiences.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.600
But as soon as it comes to the area of ​​disability,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.600
it is apparently no longer so important and

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.280
it is much more fundamental

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.280
that you think again about

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.760
where this claim actually comes from and take a step back.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.720
Even if you design and become more aware of this responsibility.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.080
Well, I think this is especially true in technology contexts.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.680
But actually in

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.720
general it is definitely the case that as designers we

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.480
take the liberty of saying, okay, I now know

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.520
what a world should look like in which there is a certain artifact.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.800
You always somehow imagine a future that doesn't yet exist

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.000
and then take the opportunity to shape it somewhere.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.000
And of course that has

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.200
an influence on other people, now on a very, very abstract level.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.880
And that can then develop into different isms.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.680
So that can

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.680
materialize into different isms, so to speak,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.680
but it can also have very different factors.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.240
And that's

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.160
to have a little more humility and to think more about

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.040
what you don't actually know or what you can't actually do.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.880
Or maybe there's a bit of this,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.120
where people are now actively taking on this hubris.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.800
That might be something I would like to see more of.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.680
So remember from design, on the one hand, to be aware of this responsibility,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.800
but also of your own approach to this responsibility

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.280
and to perceive it as an actual task,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.080
so not just saying it like that,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.120
it is always important that you reflect yourself and so

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.840
on Of course, but that can actually have an impact

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.360
, something new, how you imagine these futures,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.480
Who you include and who you don't.
