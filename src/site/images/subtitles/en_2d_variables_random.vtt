00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.480
In the previous examples we used certain numeric 
values to define the values of our variables.  

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.840
But when we are generating our parametric designs, 
sometimes it's interesting to use random values.  

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.520
Imagine for example you want to generate a 
series of variations of a certain layout or  

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.880
a certain shape, then it might be interesting 
to use a random value, to introduce noise,  

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.800
to introduce different shapes and layouts. And to 
do this, there is a really nice helper function  

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.120
from p5.js, the "random" function that we can use. 
And inside the "random" function, if we provide no  

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.520
parameters, it's a value between 0 and 1, but 
we can also provide a "min" and "max" value for  

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:00.080
the random number that should be generated. In our 
case, we want a grayscale value between 0 and 255.  

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.080
And if i save this, you can see that 
now every time i save the sketch,  

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.320
there's a different color being used as a 
background. We could of course also move this  

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.600
to our draw function. Which then would generate 
different random values on each draw cycle.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.200
There is one little important thing about the 
"random" function. The "random" function is  

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.280
part of p5.js, so it's only available once all 
the p5js setup is done. So all the setting up of  

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.360
functions and features for p5.js. So 
inside preload, inside setup, inside draw,  

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:52.320
you can use the random function. But imagine you 
want to define your variable in the "global scope"  

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.440
at the beginning of your sketch.js file. I will 
just paste the random function here and now,  

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.840
because random is not yet available, you will 
receive an error message, saying "random is not  

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.400
defined". To overcome this you can either do the 
setup as I did before, just define the variable  

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.200
in the "global scope" and then set the value 
of your variable inside the "setup" function.  

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.280
But there's also another way, because if you're 
using any other library than p5.js, you will have  

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.040
the same problem, because there is no "random" 
function. So there is a native "random" function  

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.400
and you can get it by writing "Math.random" and 
then brackets this will generate a value between 0  

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.160
and 1. It has no parameters, so you cannot define 
"min" and "max". So we need to do this manually,  

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.480
in this case, we simply need to say, the value 
between 0 and 1 should be multiplied by 255.  

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.720
Generating us a value between 0 and 255. And if I 
save this, it works again, because "Math.random()"  

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.880
is always available. Because it's a native 
JavaScript function. So just have this in mind,  

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.680
if you're defining variables in the "global scope" 
you don't have access to the "random" function,  

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.840
yet. So either use "Math.random()" or define 
the values inside the "setup" function.
