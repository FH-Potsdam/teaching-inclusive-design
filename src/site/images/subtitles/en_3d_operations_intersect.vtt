00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.640
In the last video we used the subtract 
function to remove one element from another.  

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.640
In this video we'll use the "intersect" function. 
In intersect we can also combine multiple bodies,  

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.880
but the result will be those parts of all 
the objects that we provide in the area  

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.840
that completely overlap with one another, the 
volumes of all bodies that completely overlap.  

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.640
If we just replace the subtract 
through the intersect function,  

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.800
we will now get as a result, those volumes 
and areas, that are a complete intersection  

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:54.800
between our two objects and you could do 
this with more than two objects if you want.
