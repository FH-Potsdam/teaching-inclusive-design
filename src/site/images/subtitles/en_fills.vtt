00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.280
Of course we can also give our shapes different 
colors. To do so we just need to define it. In  

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.720
our example, i will just draw a simple circle 
in the center of our canvas so 200 X, 200 Y  

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.240
and a diameter of 100. And the default color for 
all our shapes is always a fill of white and a  

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.120
stroke of black. And if we want to change the fill 
we simply use the "fill" command and now we can  

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.520
use the same color parameters as we used for the 
"background" function. For example to make it red,  

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.240
we can simply provide it with RGB values. 
And if we want to change the stroke color,  

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.080
we simply use the "stroke" command.  

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.920
And for example, add a blue stroke which is hard 
to see so we can also increase the stroke width,  

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.000
to do so, we use the "strokeWeight" command. 
And now we can simply define how many pixels  

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.560
the stroke should be. And now we can 
clearly see that we have a blue stroke here.  

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.960
If we want to add another shape here 
let's add a circle to the right.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.160
We can see that the second circle has the 
same color values than our previous circle.  

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.440
And this is again because of the order of our 
code. So again it goes from top to bottom.  

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.760
Once we define a color at the top, this color 
is being used for all commands that come  

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.800
after this. And remember that the draw function 
is being run in a loop, so if you draw something  

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.480
before this, remember that once the draw function 
is finished and it's starting again from the top,  

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.280
the same settings that we had 
at the end of the draw function,  

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.680
are still set, so if for example i add a circle 
here or simply move our circle to the top.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.280
It still has the same colors, because of the 
draw circle, if we want to change the colors  

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.960
of our circle, we simply need to call the fill 
command again and for example make it white.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960
And the color for the stroke 
stays the same because again  

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.840
it goes from top to bottom and keeps the settings.
