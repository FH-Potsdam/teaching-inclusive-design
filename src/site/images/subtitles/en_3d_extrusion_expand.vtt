We used offset to generate an expanded 2D 
object. And we can do the same for 3D bodies.  

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.720
Here we use the expand function. So let's create 
a new expand variable, where we can store our  

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.960
new expanded object in. And the parameter that 
we need is delta again. And then of course we  

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.800
need to provide our cube object and now push 
the whole thing into our objects area again.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920
Save it. And now we have an expanded 3D object.  

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.200
Expansion, depending on the complexity of 
your object, is quite computing intensive.  

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.600
If you change the segments, that should be used to 
generate the round edges, you should be careful,  

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:04.880
because the more segments you need, the longer it 
will take to generate those expanded 3d objects.
