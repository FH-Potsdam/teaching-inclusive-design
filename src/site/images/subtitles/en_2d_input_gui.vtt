There is a really nice extension plugin for 
p5.js called p5 gui. Graphical user interface.  

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.120
Through this extension, you can easily create a 
lot of different input fields. Through an object  

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.480
that you define initially and then you get this 
really nice interface that allows you to change  

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.240
parameters and access them in your code. This 
is slightly more complex than the elements i  

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:39.760
showed you before and so i added an additional 
tutorial to the bonus section in this website.
