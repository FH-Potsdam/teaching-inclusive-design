00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.800
First up is the union function 
for combining multiple objects.  

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.920
Let's create a rotated instance of our 
original cube object, let's call it rotObj,  

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.160
use our rotate function and 
rotate it by 45 degrees.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.840
And do the whole thing with our cube object.  

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.280
And then push our rotated 
object into our objects array.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.920
So we now have a rotate. Two cubes. One rotated 
by 45 degrees and it already looks like they are  

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.440
combined, but if you would export this version 
right now and open it in another 3D software  

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.960
you would see that those are still two completely 
separate 3D objects and not a combined one.  

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.440
To actually combine them, we will not 
push the individual objects into our array  

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880
but instead create a union object  

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.200
and use the union command. And the union command 
is very simple. We simply have an array here and  

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.600
in this array we can add all the different 
objects that we want to combine into one  

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:32.160
union object. In our case we want the cube object 
and the rotate object and then we push our union  

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.560
object into our objects list. And what looks 
like the same as before, is now actually only  

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.560
one geometry so there are distinct paths along 
the edges where those two connect to one another  

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:01.120
and we could use this for example in a slicer 
software to create a 3D print of this exact object
