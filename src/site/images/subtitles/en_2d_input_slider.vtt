There's a lot of different input commands that you 
can use to generate different types of inputs and  

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.280
i've added a list of the basic elements below 
this video and the links to the references that  

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.080
explain them. But there is one additional one, 
that i want to show you and that is the slider.  

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.280
Through the slider we can generate numbers on 
a certain range. Let's add a variable again,  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.160
simply call it slider. And then we can use the 
same commands that we used here, this time we just  

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.200
use the createSlider function 
and here we can provide a little  

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.360
more parameters. The first two parameters are the 
min and the max of our slider range, start with 0  

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.520
and go to 200 and then again similar to our first 
createInput, we can define the default value,  

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.600
then we can also change the position. 
Let's place it below our text field.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.920
And make the size a little bit 
bigger than our text field.  

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.960
And then in the code below, again, we simply 
say "slider.value", so we get the current value  

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.880
of the slider. And if i save this, i get this nice 
slider here. And as i move the slider knob, i can  

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.840
nicely see how our code is immediately updated 
and uses the current value of our slider here.
