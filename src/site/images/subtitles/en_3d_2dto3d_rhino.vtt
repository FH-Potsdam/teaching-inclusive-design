We can also use Rhino to turn our 2D 
vector graphics, that we exported as SVGs  

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.040
from p5.js into 3D bodies. Here, 
again, we start with the import.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.120
Lookup our SVG file. Then you get a couple of 
import options. You can just keep them as they  

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.360
are and go to "ok". And then in this case 
our vector graphics turned out quite big.  

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:50.800
Let's make them a little bit smaller and move 
them to the center again. And, voila. Right now  

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.800
our imported polygons are simply curves. We need 
to turn them into planes before we can turn them  

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.160
into 3D bodies. To do this, we have the so-called 
surface tools, that you can find up here.  

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.840
And then there is this little item here, 
which looks a little bit like a donut,  

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.000
it's the surface from planar curves tool. And this  

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.760
only works if you have the curves in just one 
plane, but as we are having a 2D object here,  

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.440
this is no problem for us. After clicking on 
this tool, we now have actually planes and not  

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.360
outlines anymore. We can see it by the little 
lines that we have now in our objects here.  

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.800
So we can now switch to the solid tools 
and select the extrusion function.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.160
Select all the curves that we want to extrude,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:04.720
press enter when we're done and we can now nicely 
extrude our polygons. Click enter as soon as we're  

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:17.360
done and we now have actual 3D bodies that we 
could start further working with it in Rhino.
