When you open the sketch.js file, you will 
already find a couple of lines of code. This  

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.000
is also sometimes referred to as a boilerplate. 
A basis we can build upon. What you see here,  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.160
is basically three functions and those functions 
are automatically called by the p5.js library,  

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.960
as soon as our js-file is loaded into the browser. 
The sequence of functions is extremely important.  

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.640
I've tried to visualize it here in the graphic. 
First up is the preload function. The preload  

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.400
function we will later on use to load additional 
assets, like fonts, images or other kinds of data.  

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.040
This will make sure that this data is completely 
loaded before anything else is being started.  

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.920
Afterwards, after everything is loaded, the setup 
function is called. Inside the setup function we  

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.040
will do things that only need to be done once in 
the beginning. Like setting certain parameters  

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.880
or in this case using the createCanvas command 
to create our canvas. Important is, if you want  

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.040
anything to be done inside the setup function. 
It needs to be placed inside the curly brackets.  

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.880
The curly brackets define what is part of the 
setup function. And the curly brackets will  

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.120
come up later on in other examples, so it's very 
important that you keep this in mind, if something  

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.840
needs to be called with this particular function, 
it needs to be inside the curly brackets.  

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.320
After everything is done inside the setup 
function. The draw function is being called.  

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.840
Interesting about the draw function 
is, it's being called in a loop.  

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.640
So right now this might not be important, as 
we're only drawing simple shapes. But later on  

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.400
when we for example create animations, that change 
over time, this repeatingly called draw function,  

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:05.760
allows us to repeatedly change certain 
parameters and thereby create animations.
