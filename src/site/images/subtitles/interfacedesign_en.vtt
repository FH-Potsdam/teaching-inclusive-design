00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.840
Yeah.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.440
My expertise
is working at the intersection of design,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.240
technology and society.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.880
Initially I studied history of design,
and then I started

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.880
practice and design,
specifically around technology.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.960
But instead of going to work

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
in the commercial sector,
I decided to work in the nonprofit sector.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.280
So I spent the last 20 years

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.960
working on social issues, and I have quite
an unusual combination of expertise

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.080
because I have both the design
and technology background,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
but also have been working
on social issues around the world.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.400
Throughout my work, I tend to work on
trying to create discussions and develop

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
learning and critical thinking around
ethics and technology design.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.680
And that means I'm either
working on helping those discussions,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.560
with kind of a public engagement
with the users who who interact

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.320
with the technologies

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.400
to help them
think about critical questions

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.520
they should be asking
about the technologies.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.680
Or I'm working with the designers
and developers who are creating the tools

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.600
and creating the dynamics, 
including future designers,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
and helping them
think about what the questions should be.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.720
In the work I've been doing
in engaging public and in different kinds

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.080
of users, in the questions of how
technology affects the way they live.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.040
We have a large scale
project called A Glass Room,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.720
and the Glass Room

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600
is kind of an exhibition format
that allows people to come and sort of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
look at the everyday technologies

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.440
that they come across,
but think about them in new ways.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.640
And so in this, we're helping them
think about, how something as simple

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.280
as adding a web browsing
or using their mobile phone

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.000
might present questions for them,
but also looking at bigger questions

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.800
around technologies being developed, like 
I, and some of the projects we're doing

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.160
that are helping, different kinds
of communities or individuals

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
think about how technology changes
the way they live.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
So, for example,
we have, a project with youth

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.880
helping them understand
something like a smartphone

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.040
that they use all the time,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.600
and they're really good
at kind of using the technology,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960
but they might not be thinking
about how it's designed.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.040
So one of the things we've done
there is developed

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.480
a kind of it's actually presented

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.200
as kind of like a poster that shows you
all the ways in which a mobile phone

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.240
might be kind of habituated
you to its use, and all the ways

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.400
in which it's kind of nudging you and,
getting you kind of addicted to it,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.800
to its, to its different functions
and helping young people and parents

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.360
and educators think about

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.960
what does it mean when designers,
are designing technologies

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.160
like smartphones
in such a way that young people

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.200
are would find it very difficult
not to use the phone all the time.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.400
So you know who's to blame in that
scenario?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.280
Is it is it the young teenager, or is it
the kind of designer of the technology

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.360
that's maybe thinking about
how to make sure

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
that those young people
keep using the tools, throughout the day?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.320
So when I've been

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.120
working with thinking about ethics
with technology designers, however,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.840
they might be more actually involved

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.720
in making the decisions
about designing those products

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.080
and not just what the
what the user needs to think about it,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
but also what you need to consider
when you're designing the products.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.120
So I often work with design teams
on technology by playing

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.240
kind of devil's advocate.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.280
So being the kind of person in the room
who is getting them to think critically

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.720
about what they're designing.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.560
So, for example,
I worked on a project which is a kind of,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.160
sort of health tracker
that you really wear on your wrist,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.520
where the people in the team
designing it were, all men, but the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.200
but the health tracker
that was to be worn on

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560
the wrist
was specifically designed for women.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.920
So one of the things I was able to do in
that team was ask them questions

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.280
that they hadn't been thinking about.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.400
So, for example, health fitness tracker
might also have location data.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.680
It might be tracking.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.560
It usually is tracking very detailed
information about that person's daily

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.240
routines and habits, like where they are,
when, for how long, how often, you know,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.760
maybe what they've eaten, maybe, you know,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.240
and who else would be interested
in that information in that person's life?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920
So looking at extreme scenarios like,
I don't know, domestic violence or people

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.960
with, body image issues,
those kinds of things

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840
like how could this tool
be used in a completely different way

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.840
than the designing it
that they have to be mindful of?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.080
And what do they need to consider that's
outside of their, normal realm of kind

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.400
of, scenarios of how they might work on
something like a health fitness tracker.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.360
So one of the ways that that could be

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.520
mitigated is thinking about
the makeup of the team itself.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.120
So who's in the team?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.360
To begin with?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360
And from what perspectives
are they imagining these scenarios?

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.120
Some of the work
I've done with tech companies,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.360
you might have a group of people
who have a very specific lifestyle,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
so they might be their scenarios
for designing might be,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.560
you know, imagine I go to a hotel
and it's annoying for me to find my key.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120
So I want to have a, I know, an app on
my phone that opens the door to Matically.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.800
But those scenarios that they're coming up

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.720
with and designing for are a very,
very specific lived experience.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.840
And if there's more diversity on the team,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.080
not only the questions
that they're asking of the product.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.440
So, you know, what are the questions

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.840
do I need to think about
when I'm accessing a hotel room?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.040
If I've got a family,
if I've got an elderly, elderly person,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.800
you know, if I'm somebody
who doesn't use a phone, for example,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.080
or has lost my phone,
you know, those are things that, like,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.200
they're not thinking about
in the design scenario,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.080
but also just the very questions
they're asking to begin with.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.040
So, you know, their priority might be,
you know, accessing a hotel

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080
because that's what they do for work.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.920
However,
there's more diversity on the team.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.960
Even the things that are being designed
to begin with might change if

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.080
that team is more diverse.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.520
One of the things you can
do, even if you don't have a diverse team,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.040
which would be ideal because that changes
the way you solve the problem,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.920
but also the problem
you're trying to solve,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.400
is you can actually use tools
and methods that can help you think about

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.040
the possible futures that you can create
when you're developing,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.120
different kinds of products
or apps or services.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.560
So when the tools that I've been using in
my work is something that I call like

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.880
a Black Mirror experience.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.600
So what does The Black Mirror
being the TV series that, looks at

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.720
technologies and how they could change
and affect things

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
in a kind of very negative way,
what could go wrong, basically.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.840
And so you can use different mechanisms
and ask different questions

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.160
in the development process that helps
you think about what could go wrong.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.720
So for example,
like what what would happen

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.120
if this tool or service that you're
designing was used by everyone?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.480
How would that change society
or who would lose out in that context?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.600
Or, you know, what is the worst headline
you can imagine of something going

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.640
wrong with this particular
thing you're designing?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.560
So these kinds of provocations,
which are used in design methodology,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
can actually help
you think about designing,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.200
more carefully
and more mindfully of those involved.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.320
One of the things I'd think about doing,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.320
in design is thinking about,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.480
is assuming
that you don't have the answers, actually,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.760
assuming that you always have to do
the extra work of the research of,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.600
you know, what's happened

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.040
with that particular area that

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.000
I always think about what can go wrong
or what did go wrong in the past,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.920
and doing the homework of thinking
that through it properly is important.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.840
And I think you can learn a lot by looking
at technologies that have gone wrong,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.160
by looking at different kinds of,
you know,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.640
news stories, different crises in the past
and so on to see how things can be used.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.040
And I think that's because
you might design something with one

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.120
very specific good intention in mind,
but it can be used for another.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760
And that's something really important
to think about in the design process,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.400
because it comes down to the question
of who's responsible for that.
