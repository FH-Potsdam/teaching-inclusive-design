In the last video we used the extrusion function 
to turn a 2D shape into a 3D object. There's also  

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.320
the so-called offset function, which 
allows us to manipulate 2D shapes.  

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.520
It is similar to offsets that you might 
know from vector editing software.  

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
Let's create an offset object, where 
we can store our new object in.  

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.960
And then we use the "offset" function, which 
takes an object for parameters again, then we  

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.720
provide it with our rectangle object and we push 
the resulting object into our objects array.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
And here, we need to provide a so-called "delta". 
The delta is the value by which we increase  

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.960
or decrease our object size. 
Let's say we start with 20 here.  

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.840
So now we have the same object just expanded 
by 20 units. We could also do the same in  

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.240
the other direction and decrease the size. 
And there's an additional attribute for the  

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.360
corners of our object. The default is the edge 
variant. Here we just have a sharp edge for the  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.400
corners that we create. But there is also a 
"chamfer" variant, this creates flat edges  

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.160
around our object. And the last one is "round" and 
if you're just using the default values, this will  

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.160
not look different to our previous option. 
But if we add a different "segments" option,  

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.160
let's say 32. Again if you're doing circles or 
anything round, you need to provide the segments,  

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.800
so the system knows how many sections it should 
generate, how many segments it should use  

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:07.840
to try and generate our round shapes. And now 
we have round edges around our expanded object
