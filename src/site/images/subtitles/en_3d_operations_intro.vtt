The functions for manipulating objects, that we 
explored so far, are used to move objects around  

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.040
or change their size or change their color. The 
next set of functions, the boolean operations are  

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.440
used to combine multiple objects with one another. 
With union we can combine multiple objects into  

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.480
one. This is very important. If we want to use the 
output of our process in a fabrication process,  

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.840
like 3D printing, because then you don't 
want individual loose objects that are not  

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.680
completely combined, but you need one combined 
union object, that you can then send to a slicer  

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:54.080
software, so that the 3D printing is properly 
prepared. With substract we can subtract one or  

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.960
multiple shapes from another shape. Intersect is 
where multiple shapes overlap. Scission is a bit  

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.640
tricky, if you did a union before, but actually 
not all of your objects are touching one another,  

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.880
or at least have an edge, where they touch 
each other. Then with scission, after a union,  

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.400
we can select those objects that are not really 
touching at any point. We get back, we get  

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:31.760
returned an array with all the individual objects 
that are not in some way linked to one another.
