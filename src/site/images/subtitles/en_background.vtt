After we've set up our drawing canvas we 
can now begin with the actual drawing.  

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.280
The first thing in many cases that we will do,  

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.960
is set the background color. For this we don't 
need to tell the command how big our canvas is,  

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.680
it automatically knows this. But there is in 
some cases the instance where you actually  

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.880
don't want a background color. For example if you 
want to export later on a png with a transparent  

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.360
background, then of course you don't want to 
draw a background. But in most cases, drawing a  

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.040
background as a first command, is a good thing to 
do. Therefore we call the background command and  

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.800
then we provide it with the parameter. Tt defines 
the color. In this case it's just a grayscale  

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.840
background that goes from 0 for black to 255 
for white. More on colors in the next video.
