00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.280
So far we use p5.js's shape functions to 
draw our shapes like this rectangle here.  

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.640
but if we want to draw more complex 
shapes we need to go beyond this and  

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.160
to do so we might need to want to look into what 
are these shapes actually. so all the shapes even  

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.080
the ones we draw through the p5.js functions are 
made up of individual points which are connected  

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.200
to one another with a line and if we 
have a bunch of points connected by lines  

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.080
which then are also closed then we're talking 
about a polygon. and if we're going even into  

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.160
the third dimension then we usually have a set 
of polygons that define the shape of a 3d object.  

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.440
So if we go back to our rectangle. Our 
rectangle is made up of four points,  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.160
the four corners. So to just visualize this, i 
will draw a couple of points on the exact corners.  

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.080
I will change the strokeWeight here and 
now i will simply draw a couple of points  

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.680
so we start in the upper left corner and then 
we add the other points so the next one is  

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:29.360
at 300/100, 300/300 and 100/300. Now we 
have the rectangle that we have drawn before  

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.720
and now we need to connect them through lines 
and there's a really nice set of functions that  

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.480
helps us do this so if we want to start a 
new shape the function is called beginShape  

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.200
so everything we write now will become part of our 
shape and to draw the individual points which are  

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.560
then connected to one another. We have the vertex 
command. I would simply replace all the points  

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.880
here through the vertex command and the vertex 
command now also takes the x and y coordinate as  

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.000
a position, where our shape should be drawn. And 
in the end when we're done we simply say endShape.  

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.640
And if we save this, we can now see how the shape 
function uses the vertex command to go through  

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.000
all our points. But our shape is not closed. 
What we can do to close our shape is for once  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.360
simply repeat the first point in the end, 
but there is a more elegant solution to this.  

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.440
If you simply want to connect the last to the 
first point we can write CLOSE inside the endShape  

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.960
command and then it's done automatically 
for us. Now with this shape we can do  

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.440
everything we have done before with the p5.js 
shapes. For example we could add a fill here  

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.720
and then our shape receives the fill. We 
can create very complex shapes using just  

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.360
these vertexes commands. Of course we cannot 
only draw straight lines we can also draw  

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:15.200
curves. Those are a little bit more complex and i 
will tell you more about these in the next videos.
