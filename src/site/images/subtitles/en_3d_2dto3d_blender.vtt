00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.960
In this first video, i will show you how you 
can import the SVG graphics that we created  

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.800
using p5.js into the open source software 
Blender, to turn them into 3D bodies.  

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.240
The first part, obviously, we 
need to import our SVG graphics,  

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.840
therefore, we have this "scalable vector 
graphics" format, that we can import.  

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.320
I will select the curves that i previously 
created and now we can nicely see here the SVG  

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.360
polygons, that i created. And we 
can also see up here in the right,  

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.360
that we can see each individual polygon that we 
created. And we can now select them individually,  

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.960
in order to make this a little bit better 
to see, i will turn to the wireframe format.  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.920
And now i want to turn them 
into actual solid bodies.  

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.320
For this we need to add a modifier. Use the 
little tool here and then we use the solidify  

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.000
modifier and we can immediately see that we 
now have a 3D body and not a 2D body anymore.  

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.280
Using the solidify, we can define in which 
direction we want to extrude our body.  

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.800
Here now to the top and of course you can also 
define a few other parameters. And of course,  

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.560
if you have a lot of polygons, it would be 
a lot of work to individually modify them.  

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.000
To do this a bit faster, we will 
select the remaining three polygons  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.480
and then we will go to object and join. And 
you can now see that we have now a join here,  

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.440
with all our three previous polygons and we 
can now simply apply the modifier to our group.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800
Make this a little bit bigger than the first one.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.440
First one up here.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.360
And so now we have 3D bodies that 
we could obviously also export  

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.120
and for example export them back again, to the STL  

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.840
format and use the STL format for example 
into a slicer to then send it to a 3D printer
