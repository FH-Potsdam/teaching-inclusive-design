00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.320
Yes, I'm Jan Wielert.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.000
I am an industrial designer and managing director and partner in the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.120
Staubach office.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.880
So, we are a design office

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.080
with a focus on mobility broadly.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.240
So, I started here around 15 years ago.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.200
And back then there were a few other topics that we worked on.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.360
Classic product design, capital goods, also digital topics.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.600
And we have increasingly moved into the area of ​​public transport

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.120
and really design everything from complete vehicles, interior

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.280
exterior drivers, stamping design to small components.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.960
We provide strategy consulting for, for example

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.200
, some federal states in Germany when it comes to local transport services.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.080
And we move in this big circle.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.840
What is very important to me, for example, are projects

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.960
where we naturally come on board at an early stage.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.680
For example, this is the current project

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.040
that we have been doing for the Hamburger Hochbahn for four years.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.120
This involves a new vehicle procurement and in such large projects

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.360
there is sometimes the possibility that we can

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.840
do so before the vehicle is procured.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.000
Um, yes, we care about design-relevant issues

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.120
and passenger issues, so that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.920
the requirements for Das are formulated very specifically in the ordering process in the tender

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360
and not only purely technical requirements

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.000
may be included there, but also qualitative factors.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.960
This has

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.880
a lot to do with accessibility and I would like to call it the vehicle or the offer

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.480
.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.640
The mobility offer is discussed

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
and specified on a different level.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.960
So yes, basically

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
there is their freedom in the projects we work on.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.000
Imperative and self-evident and, as you said, of course

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.240
required by law.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.560
That's of course even if you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.760
just said that, we also work

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.680
in different regions of the world.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.760
Of course, things are sometimes different.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.120
There are regulations here, whether the TS, IBM,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.200
which then specifically sets regulations for vehicles, or the TA in the USA.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.120
And these are the norms and laws that exist.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960
These are relatively concrete specifications.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.080
Of course you do that.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.760
But there is also a lot more.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.200
I call it further material.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.720
For example, there are recommendation papers, position papers from interest groups

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.560
that give recommendations on how things

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.840
should be designed

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.640
and the most important thing, however, is actually

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.120
the exchange with affected people

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.600
who want to use local transport and are for us.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.880
So mobility is a basic need and per se it should be inclusive. And if we

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.240
can carry out preliminary development

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.000
early in the design process -

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.200
as I just mentioned with the Hamburger Hochbahn - before

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.440
the vehicles are procured , then we

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.240
logically talk to all the people involved.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.280
And of course these are the people who have no idea how to clean the vehicle.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.720
It's the people who drive the vehicle.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.880
But of course there are also interest groups, associations

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.200
for mobility, people with disabilities, for example.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.600
And if you then talk about things specifically,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.120
you gain even more knowledge, which

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.920
could improve the quality of local transport.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.320
So I have a nice example.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.560
We had built the suspension railway in Wuppertal

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.520
and had it there as part of our workshop.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.720
It was about materials

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.480
and materials and that is of course also a relevant

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.240
topic for you people with disabilities, i.e. how can I recognize a problem, etc.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.680
And there was a person sitting there

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
holding this one handrail the whole time and then was really excited about it,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.600
that it had a different powder coating,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.760
that your hands no longer got so sweaty,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.880
that you can just hold on to it better.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.840
These are things that cannot be stipulated in any standard,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.280
You can actually only experience this through direct exchange.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.320
Basically, our

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.440
aim is to create a universal offer.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.800
And that is something where I think we

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.120
are experiencing an interesting time, especially in the mobility discourse.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240
Because

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.520
more and more exclusive offers are being discussed on a large stage and offers are being differentiated.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.320
And that is actually exactly the opposite of inclusion.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.320
And we are very much in favor of

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.880
offering a comparable offer for everyone at every door.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.880
And of course that may exclude luxury offerings such as massage chairs,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.880
but it does have great added value for the general public,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
for every person who moves there.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.320
There are many positive experiences. We.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.600
We can get through.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.400
Through the insights we gain, I think we

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.840
can raise awareness quite well.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360
You may be a little disillusioned

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.240
that there is no ideal solution, but that there

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.280
is actually always a compromise solution.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.680
And it is important to sensitize the person to this

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.200
and gain understanding for it.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.680
So if you now think of it as accessibility.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.640
For example, the needs of a very tall person

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.000
and the needs of a very short person

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.080
are diametrically opposed and you have to

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.080
somehow create offers for both.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080
And it's the same

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.680
with many, many aspects when it comes to information media, etc.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.520
And of course, there are tools that allow you to use multiple senses

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.720
and always try to address as many channels as possible according to one principle

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.720
when it comes to important information.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.840
This allows you to cover a broad, indeed a broad, field.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.520
But in the end it is always about compromises

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.480
and if these are understood and the process

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.880
is discussed in a larger group and a result is achieved,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.280
then you automatically have multipliers,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.200
so to speak, who will pass this on in their associations and interest groups.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.920
And the result is suddenly no longer something that seems God-given

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.040
and suddenly,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.920
for example, there is

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.840
a new vehicle in our industry and you ask yourself why is it like that?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.200
Rather, the process is a little more understandable and well-founded.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.480
And that's a bit

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.720
like you did your homework,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.720
so to speak, and took things seriously and didn't

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.160
design them on your own initiative, but really according to real needs.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.240
I think this ties directly into the last question.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.520
First of all, understand that you are not designing for yourself.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.440
I think that's really important.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.200
That's something that you

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.920
learn a little bit in the university context, but in the end you

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.080
're often closest to yourself and do it

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.480
the way you think is right.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.440
Especially when it comes to formal aesthetic questions.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.200
And of course there are attitudes and that's okay

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200
if that happens, if you find your way there.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.480
But I think it's important to have a basic understanding that you don't

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.400
design for your own interests.
