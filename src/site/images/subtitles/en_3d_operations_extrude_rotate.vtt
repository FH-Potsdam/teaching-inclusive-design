There's one thing i forgot about extrudeRotate. 
So far we had the variant where we had a 2D shape,  

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.400
it was flipped 90 degrees on its side and 
then it was rotating around its center point.  

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.040
But if you remember when we were defining 
our 2D shapes we can also define the center,  

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:34.320
where our 2D shape is located. If i add 
an offset here, let's say 75 and i save it  

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.000
and we now look at the outcome of our 
extrudeRotate. It is still the same thing  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.640
happening. So we have our flipped object and it's 
now rotating with an offset around the center.  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If i for example switch this now from 90 degrees 
to 360 degrees, we can now nicely see how our  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.120
rectangle is in 12 segments rotating around 
the center. And if i decrease this, let's say  

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.200
six steps, we can nicely see now the six steps 
our rectangle is taking. Or we can increase it,  

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.160
to make it more round and of course we can 
use all other shapes that we had before.  

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.840
Let's use the circle quickly. This one 
uses the radius instead of the size.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.280
Save this.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.800
Oh we need to write circle correctly.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
And now we get a nice little 
donut here and we could  

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.520
decrease the radius a bit and increase our offset.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.000
So now you can take any 2D shape you 
have and use it with an offset to  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.520
create even more interesting shapes 
through the rotate functionality.
