00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.600
In the beginning our code looks 
quite straightforward and simple,  

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.080
but the more features we add, the more lines 
of code we write, the more messy it gets. So  

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.440
it can be quite useful to add comments inside the 
code. So that later on, you remember what you were  

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.560
thinking, when you were writing this code. There 
are two options to do this. The first one is a  

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.280
so-called single line comment. This we can already 
see here, in line two. We simply use two slashes  

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.720
and then we can add our comment, but this can 
only be one line of comments. If i add a new line,  

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.600
this is not a comment anymore. We can 
immediately see this when we use the Visual  

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.720
Studio Code editor, because here in the code 
highlighting, we can see that this line is now  

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.800
marked as a green, as a comment line. And 
the next line again is a normal code line.  

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.880
But sometimes you need to write a 
little bit longer comments. Then we have  

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.480
multi-line comments. Therefore, we use the slash 
an asterisk and another one. And then we have a  

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.280
start and an end element and then inside we can 
now write multiple lines of code of comments.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.600
And can write as long, as many comments as you 
want. These comment features are interesting for  

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.520
documenting our code, but they're also interesting 
for developing code, because sometimes you're  

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.640
adding features and then you realize there's a 
problem inside the code or you want to experiment  

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
with your code. And then it can be quite 
interesting to comment out certain parts of your  

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.680
code. For example if i don't want this background 
function to be called, i can simply add these two  

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.360
slashes in the front and now it's a comment and 
not a code line anymore. And i can simply remove  

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:01.200
this and now it's a code again. And of course 
i can do the same with the multi-line comments.
