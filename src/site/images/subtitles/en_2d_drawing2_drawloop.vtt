00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.760
Our draw loop is continually running over and 
over again. This can be very helpful when we  

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.960
try to create different variations, when we try to 
create animations, but sometimes especially when  

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.480
you create something very complex, it can also 
be counterproductive. I've created a very simple  

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.440
example here that generates a grid of circles 
where the size of the circles is generated by a  

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.160
random function. And now we can see that the 
loop is continuously running the draw loop  

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.480
but maybe we just want one iteration of this and 
then stop it. To do this, there is a very simple  

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.680
function it's called noLoop() and as soon as we 
call this command the draw loop stops and does  

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.680
not continue. As soon as we delete it or call the 
loop() function it would start again. This is very  

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.840
helpful when we draw something complex or we just 
want one iteration. There's an additional function  

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.000
that helps us with this that can slow down the 
draw function and this is the frameRate function.  

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.560
Inside the frameRate function we can define how 
often per second the draw loop should be called.  

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.920
Right now it's only called once per second and we 
can now also increase this maybe say 100 times per  

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.920
second. But as you see this now, you might notice 
it doesn't look much faster than it did before and  

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520
this is simply a performance reason. You cannot 
increase the frame rate to a really really high  

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.400
number, because your computer still needs to 
draw all the elements that you define in your  

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.760
draw function, so the actual maximum speed, the 
maximum frame rate of your sketch strongly depends  

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:53.840
on your computer on the performance of your 
computer as well as the complexity of your sketch
