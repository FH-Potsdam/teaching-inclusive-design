00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.920
Welcome to the Parametric Design introduction. 
Before we go into the actual parametric design,  

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.960
i want to quickly go into the modern design 
process, which is nowadays completely digital.  

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.520
So we have various applications, coming from 
various providers, like Adobe or the Sketch App,  

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.240
which is used by many interface designers, or 
Figma. And all those applications come with this  

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.120
kind of idea, as Figma says it here, "bring ideas 
to life". So that we can make anything possible  

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.960
and be super innovative and super efficient. 
But when we look at how we interact with those  

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.360
applications, they of course have tons of great 
features, but as they are designed by other people  

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.080
for us, we also have to use their concepts, 
their ideas of how we construct our designs.  

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.200
So there's also certain limitations, when we use 
those applications, about how we actually turn our  

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.680
ideas into actual visual artifacts. And sometimes 
we need to take a step back from using these great  

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.240
applications and really think about our ideas and 
can those applications, that have been designed  

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.960
and developed by other people for us, actually are 
they the right tool to bring our ideas to life.  

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.320
Or are we actually only using the way that they 
have developed for us, to create our designs.  

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.880
And is this not really helping us bring our our 
own ideas to life. And of course every medium has  

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.360
its limitations. Even if we work on paper we are 
limited by the tools that we have at hand. But in  

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.000
paper for example, we still are able to do so much 
more, we can crumble our paper, we can put it on  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.720
fire, we can dip it in liquid colors, paint, we 
can do whatever we want with this piece of paper.  

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.320
But in the digital world we are really limited 
to those tools that others have provided for us.  

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.280
And we're not really able to get completely 
creative, because we need to use those tools. So  

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.040
in this seminar, we're really trying to go beyond 
those limitations. Try to think about how can we  

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.240
create our own tools and really bring our ideas to 
life. But when we're talking about digital design,  

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200
we also need to talk about what kind of data 
are we generating through our design process.  

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.160
So it's usually starts with raw text, this is 
like the most raw kind of output we can generate.  

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.600
On the next level, we have layouted documents. 
So here every piece of text has additional  

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.640
information, on how to present it, where it's 
positioned on a page, what kind of font, what kind  

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.720
of font size, etc. So these documents are usually 
some kind of markup documents, where every piece  

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.840
of text has additional information on styling, 
etc. And then we have image data. Image data  

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.760
has individual pixels, where each pixel has some 
color information to it and that's basically  

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.400
it. And then we have the next level, which is 
vector information. So on vector information,  

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.000
they're a lot more complex than the raster 
pixel information, here we have individual paths  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.760
that are connected and here we have the 
two layers, on the one hand we have 2D data  

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.360
and then we have 3D data. Even 3D 
data is made up of vector information,  

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.120
so here we have individual points, 
that are connected to one another,  

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.440
those create different planes and through these 
different planes we can create our bodies.  

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.200
In this seminar we will primarily work with image 
data and vector data. We will use these two types  

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.840
of output, because we can use these two types of 
outputs in a variety of different applications.  

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.040
So the things we will generate through code, we 
can then use to import them into other types of  

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.080
applications. Again so when we talk about these 
different types of files, the applications are  

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.240
then our interpreters, they help us see what is 
inside those files, and they help us manipulate  

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.840
those files, through interactions, through the 
interactions that the developers provide for us.  

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.120
And when we talk about these kind of 
files that we open through applications,  

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.960
we also need to talk about the different 
types of file formats that are out there.  

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.400
There are so called proprietary formats. 
Proprietary formats are used by companies to limit  

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.760
the kinds of applications you open a file with. 
So a propriety format can only be opened with  

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.720
a certain application, from a certain company. 
These are the type of files we are not looking  

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000
into in this seminar. We are looking for open 
formats, open formats can be opened by a lot  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.520
of different applications. Ideally, an open format 
is strongly standardized. A good example for this,  

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.640
is the SVG format. The SVG format is a format that 
allows us to store vector information in it. The  

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.680
the SVG format is being generated and controlled 
by an open community, by a big open community.  

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.360
So it's very well documented, it's an open format 
and it's well standardized. So nowadays thanks  

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.560
to this process, any kind of a graphics editing 
application can open an SVG format. So these are  

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.200
the kinds of formats we're trying to export, so 
that our information, that we generate our design  

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.200
files, we generate are perfectly compatible, 
with any kinds of applications out there.  

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.280
The idea again instead of only having the 
interpreter, our applications, and the interfaces  

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.440
that are provided for us, we build code or we 
build our own applications, through code, which  

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.440
are then exporting certain design files, which 
we can then open in other design applications  

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.080
and continue working on them. And we will do this 
for 3D information, as well as 2D information.  

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.320
And we will use two different kinds of libraries 
for this. We will use JSCAD, which is a 3D design  

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.920
application and p5js, which we will use for 
the raster information as well as 2D vector  

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.680
information. And the output we can really use in a 
variety of different processes, like fabrication:  

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.920
like 3D printing or cnc milling or laser cutting 
traditional printing or working with textiles  

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.160
or even a cutter service, where you can cut 
out things from paper or fabrics or other  

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.480
materials. So there's a really really big variety 
on how to use these different types of outputs.  

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.600
And of course in digital design there's even more 
ways you can use this. And just to give you a few  

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.840
examples: from web development to AR and VR to 
video, you could generate a series of images  

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.360
and turn it into a video or to go even further 
import data and visualize the data and, thereby,  

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.640
create a data visualization, or you could use 
the generated images as textures or bump maps  

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.960
in any 3D application that you use for 
3D design. What is parametric design?  

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.840
There's a lot of different definitions 
out there. So every community has another  

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.000
definition and there's also other names for 
parametric design, like generative design.  

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.640
And for example in architecture Zaha Hadid and her 
colleagues wrote a parametric design manifesto,  

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.480
where they are trying to describe their personal, 
individual perspective on parametric design in  

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:49.280
architecture. But what brings all those different 
definitions together is really the basic idea of  

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:56.960
parametric design. In traditional design we move 
and layout and design individual objects manually,  

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.400
so we select colors, we define an exact size of 
an object, we position it on a canvas somewhere.  

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.680
In parametric design we're trying to remove 
this manual process to a certain degree and  

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.680
replace it through these parameters. The 
parameters are basically definitions.  

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.760
So for example let's say we have a simple design 
here and we want to make these different radii,  

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:30.800
the the inner radius, the outer radius. We want 
to design through parameters. So we could define  

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.440
an outer parameter, then we can define the 
inner parameter and even make them related  

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.880
to one another. So we could say the inner radius 
for example is 90 percent of the outer radius.  

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.240
The idea is really to define these different 
parameters and based on these parameters we  

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.960
generate our design. We can design ratios, so 
there's a certain ratio between width and height  

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.120
for example. Or between different thickness of 
different borders and lines etc. And these for  

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.800
example can help us design and develop complex 
different patterns and variations of patterns.  

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.720
And throughout the next few slides i will try to 
show you a lot of different examples where we see  

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:17.920
parametric design being applied in 
various different fields. A good example,  

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.880
a current example, is the latest Android system. 
In the latest Android system, they developed a  

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.440
new way of how the UI is designed or how the 
colors of the UI are applied to the system.  

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.000
And so here in the latest version, you can 
choose a background image for your home screen  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.240
and based on the background image a few dominant 
colors are being extracted from the image and  

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.320
those colors from the image are then being 
applied to the overall UI in the whole system.  

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.960
And this shows really nicely what is extremely 
important and very different to traditional design  

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.760
in parametric design, because in parametric design 
you really need to learn how to think in systems.  

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.040
So you need to move away from designing small 
individual objects, but really think about  

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.560
the relationship between different objects, for 
example think about the relationship of contrast  

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.000
between different colors. When you extract 
dominant colors from an image, you also need to  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.320
think about that you need to have foreground and 
background colors and you need to have contrast  

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.480
between them, so that people can actually 
differentiate between different layers and  

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.320
elements. So you really need to think about rules 
and systems when it comes to parametric design.  

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.280
This is a really nice example 
going back into the analog again.  

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.600
Boris Müller, one of our professors here at the 
interface design department, he did a poster  

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.840
series. It's almost 10 years ago, so it's an old 
project, but i think they're still beautiful.  

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.760
He developed these generative designs to create 
these really nice patterns and he actually in most  

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.320
of them he actually also used data to generate 
them. And he then uses them in a poster design.  

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.640
So you can take these generative designs that 
were create through code and bring them again  

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.200
into analog designs, into print designs 
or poster designs. There's a lot of nice  

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.600
examples in the corporate design world, 
where there are generative logos being  

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.840
developed. Like this one, from onformative or 
here an example that was developed a few years ago  

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.200
for the MIT media lab. And here you can see again, 
through parametric design there's one system being  

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.160
generated, but based on those system, there's 
a whole variation of different outputs being  

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.640
generated here. Or here's a nice example from 
a conference, that was done by some researchers  

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.000
here at our university a few years back, and they 
created this generative header for their website.  

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.280
And this is also really great for 
experimentation. You could for example  

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.680
use some random values that are being generated 
in your design, so certain parameters are fixed,  

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.880
certain parameters are random and, thereby, 
just generate some different outputs and see  

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.760
how things interact with one another and really 
explore different variations of your design.  

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.360
And of course this also works in a 3D space. 
Here's an example where designers explore  

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.840
different variations of a 3D space and a 
system to generate different 3D models.  

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.440
And what is also great about generating 
things through code, so visual artifacts,  

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.800
is that you can also create very very complex 
things, that would take ages to build manually,  

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.480
through code really quickly. Like building things, 
like this here, where you have different shapes  

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.520
and different structures, but through different 
mathematical formulas you can generate those  

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:54.080
shapes automatically, without no need of actually 
placing all these different vectors in 3D space.  

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.360
And you can do this for all kinds of 
products and concepts in 3D space.  

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.600
And there's a lot of different 
math formulas that we will also  

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.120
look into, in this seminar. And in architecture 
there's a lot of great examples, where generative  

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.400
design or parametric design is used to explore 
variations, but also create shapes that would  

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.960
otherwise be way too complex to generate manually. 
Zaha Hadid and her team did a lot of great  

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.120
work on algorithmic design and parametric design 
to generate new shapes that would otherwise be not  

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.880
possible to generate. A good example also is the 
Elb-philharmonie in Hamburg. Here the the windows,  

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.680
that we can see, were also designed through 
an algorithmic design process to generate  

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:50.800
this visual scene that we can see now here. In 
how the windows being placed on the building.  

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.080
And especially in facades we can do a lot of 
interesting things to generative design concepts,  

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.880
explore different variations even have things like 
the weather, interact with our facades, so that  

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:14.320
our our parametric design facade is changing as 
certain parameters in our environment change. Or  

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.640
we can take it a step further and also use other 
things from kinetic to screens to change facades  

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.440
and how they interact with the environment. 
To get started and for inspiration, there's a  

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.760
really great book called Generative Design, which 
has a lot of great mostly 2D examples to get you  

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.120
started, what is nice about the book, is that you 
also get code examples for every example showed in  

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.840
the book. To give you a really nice introduction 
and some examples to get started with.  

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.840
In my personal work, i work a lot with data 
and generative or parametric design. This is  

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.480
an example here, where we used spatial data to 
visualize the green and water spaces in Berlin.  

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.120
And try to take it a step further into 
the physical and we used a laser cutter  

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.760
to create this 3D map of Berlin and then we used 
plants to actually visualize the green spaces.  

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:16.880
Or here, taken the third dimension even further, 
creating 3D city maps from data in Berlin.  

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.160
So from these basic examples, that we will 
all look into, throughout the semester. Of  

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.560
course you can take it even further, from data 
visualization to other kinds of applications that  

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.960
have parametric design already implemented. Like 
Rhino 3D. They have a lot of parametric design  

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.640
capabilities right built in. And so you can use 
all the knowledge that you will gain from the  

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.920
seminar, for example in other applications that 
are already made for these kind of processes.  

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.520
So parametric design is really about 
going beyond the design capabilities that  

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.040
software already provides for us and really 
thinking about how can you bring your ideas
