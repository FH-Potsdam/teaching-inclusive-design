00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.400
My name is Oliver Tollmann.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.480
I am a lawyer and I teach

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
medical law at the University of Göttingen.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.960
I've been doing this for 20 years now.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.960
And in my life before that, my professional life before that, I

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.920
worked as a journalist, for newspapers like the taz, but also

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
still write occasionally today.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.600
In Germany, there are

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
a number of laws

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.720
at state and federal level

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.360
that deal with inclusion in some way.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.480
Very central and particularly important for practice is

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
and, in social law, Social Code Nine,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.880
which regulates the participation rights of people with disabilities.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.640
At the level of constitutional law, we have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
Article three, paragraph three, sentence two of the Basic Law,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960
which prohibits any discrimination due to disability

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
and is therefore, so to speak, the highest standard.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.640
And if I have no less, none specifically,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.040
then when it comes to inclusion, I can

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.360
rely on this claim of the Basic Law,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.400
the principle of equal treatment.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.520
But what we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
don't have, perhaps it's important to say,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.960
is a comprehensive law that covers

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.040
the very different dimensions of inclusion

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.120
at school, at work,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640
in leisure time, for tall people, for short people,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.720
for Adults, for children, for young people, for men,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800
for women, for intersex, for transgender, people.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Unfortunately, we don't have a way to summarize it all.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
And that makes it very difficult sometimes.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
The Accessibility Strengthening Act

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.160
is not a German invention, but is a European regulation.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
The European Accessibility Act, which must be implemented into German law.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.440
This is important to be clear about.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.040
Because if you have to implement something

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.040
at the European level, you can go two ways.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.240
You can do what you absolutely have to do because you have to.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.680
Or you say great opportunity, now let's do something really

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.520
good and add further regulations.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
And it's about accessibility strengthening law, the question of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.320
how do we make products that are offered by private individuals,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.680
in the area of ​​services, of goods, of all sorts of things,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.280
how do we make them accessible to everyone?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.360
Universal design is one of the keywords behind it.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.080
And unfortunately the Federal Republic has decided to do it the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.200
way it has to and not to put any further innovations into it.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.160
This means that, for example,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.480
sign language and easy language

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.120
play no role in the Accessibility Strengthening Act,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.040
although they are of course of fundamental importance

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.520
for an inclusive society and for inclusive design.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.200
So the legislator didn't think here:

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.160
We want innovation, we want to be innovative, we want to do something,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.720
we want to develop something new because it's great, because it's important,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.160
because everyone benefits when society is inclusive.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.240
That's not a way of thinking for a part of society, but

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.200
he said, Uh, that could cause difficulties.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.200
Small businesses may not be able to pay,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.040
which is why we are creating many exceptions,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.040
which is why we are creating regulations so that some regulations

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.800
do not have to come into force and be implemented until 2040.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800
That means it has become a rather sad law.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.960
You can therefore

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.240
sue individually with the help of legal regulations to prevent discrimination.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.760
It is better if you can sue as an association,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.720
a sign association or a sign language association,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.400
i.e. an association of the deaf or an association of wheelchair users

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.440
or the Council for the Disabled or someone.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.480
However, we have very little legal basis

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.480
that allows people with disabilities

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.400
who are organized in associations to get something done as an association.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.400
But we are working on it.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.880
And that would be, so to speak, the perception of collective interests,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.000
Just as the law already exists in environmental protection, for example.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.120
We have to achieve this with people for people with disabilities in our society

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.120
.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.240
I think it is important for people who want to shape things

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.680
that they are brave, braver than our legislators.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.720
For example, they say that

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720
when we design something, we immediately do it in such a way

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.080
that it is surprising and you ask yourself

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.040
why hasn't it always been like this?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.560
You have to design inclusively, and inclusively in a very comprehensive sense

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.560
for people with disabilities, for all people, for young people,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.760
for people with a migrant background, for people with different

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.160
sexual orientations.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.280
There's so much where you can say we're making things simple,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.120
but perhaps also completely different than they were before and in such a way

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.120
that anyone and everyone can use them and work with them.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.400
More competencies, more skills with it.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.080
And if you have this claim, then it sells.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.000
Firstly, I think it does quite well.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And secondly, it looks good

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.640
in the best case scenario and you can do a lot more with it.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.840
And that is actually

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.400
what the legislature should do as designers of laws

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.200
and what they can do, without

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.600
having to pay attention to voters, but as designers

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.440
in their products and the goods

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.920
and services they develop , that would be great.
