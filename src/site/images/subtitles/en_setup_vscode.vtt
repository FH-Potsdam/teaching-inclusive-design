00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.920
Visual studio code is open source and free to use, 
which makes it a great tool to use in a seminar  

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.560
like this. But there's also a big community 
behind visual studio code, that is developing  

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.880
new extensions that we can use inside visual 
studio. The first thing you might notice is,  

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.000
after installing visual studio code, it might 
not look like the editor i'm using here. And  

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.680
this is because we can use different themes to 
style our editor for us. Through the preferences  

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.960
you can select different styles, so that it 
fits your preference and it is to your liking.  

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.320
Next up, the activity bar here. This is a 
really nice tool to give you quick access to  

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.880
different views and tools inside visual studio. 
Sometimes it does not initially show up. To  

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.360
make it show up, go to view, appearance 
and then then select the show activity bar.  

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.000
This will give you the bar on the left, so 
you have quick access to different views.  

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.720
The most important one is the one on the top 
here. The explorer. This will show you the actual  

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.800
content of your currently open folder, so you 
can actually access different files in the folder  

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.280
on the right side. You now get the 
actual text editor and what is nice,  

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.720
you can also open multiple files in parallel. 
So you can open multiple panes here and,  

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.840
thereby, for example, compare two files or copy 
paste certain things from one file to another.  

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.080
In addition there are other options like the the 
git tool, that i will show you in the next video  

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.440
and there is the extensions. One extension that 
we are using in the seminar is the so-called live  

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.560
server. If you enter live server in the search 
bar up here, it should show you the live server  

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.360
extension. And once you click on it. It should 
show an install button, right here. So after  

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.520
installing it you get immediate access to it. 
You don't need to restart visual studio code to  

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.800
use it. And if you're looking on your own for 
other extensions that might be helpful, always  

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.560
have in mind that these extensions are developed 
by the open source community and some might be  

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.160
experimental. So if you're not sure, always make 
sure that the amount of people that have already  

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200
installed this extension is quite big, this makes 
sure that there's already a lot of people using  

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.680
it and so it's probably stable and safe to use. 
For most extensions you can also check on GitHub  

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.160
the actual source code, if you're interested 
what this extension is doing on your machine.  

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.760
So in the next video, when i show you how to set 
up a new project, i will also show you how to  

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.480
use the live server extension. This is a 
rough overview of the most important features  

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:10.320
of visual studio code and we will now 
start creating our own projects and files.
