An important part of coding is debugging. Figuring 
out what is not working in your code. And there's  

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.600
a really nice tool, that helps you do this: the 
Web Developer Tools. If you have your sketch  

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.160
open in your browser, simply do a right-click on 
the website and click on the "inspect" button. If  

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.760
you're using Safari, you might need to activate 
the developer tools first. I've added a link in  

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.640
the description below the video how to do this. By 
default, the developer tools open as part of your  

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960
browser window, which makes it hard to actually 
see the original content that you're working on.  

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.840
If you click on the three dots in the upper 
right, you can switch to the window-mode,  

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.200
where you get a separate window for the developer 
tools. The developer tools give you a lot of  

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.560
different insights into how your website is 
performing and how it works. From "elements",  

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.920
which show you the HTML and CSS structure of your 
websites, to "network", which shows you which  

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.560
files are being loaded by your website, to the 
"console". And the "console" is the most important  

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.480
part for us inspecting our JavaScript. In the 
"console" you will see any errors coming up,  

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.680
to demonstrate this, i will quickly switch back to 
the code and change the name of the "background"  

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.560
command and just delete the D. So that it's 
the wrong command name. And if i save this,  

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.000
we can immediately see that the background is not 
drawn anymore and if i switch to the developer  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.160
tools we now see an error here. The error is 
marked as red and we can see that there is an  

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.040
"unknown reference error" and "backgroun is not 
defined", because the p5.js library in JavaScript  

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.120
doesn't know the command "backgroun" without a D. 
And we get some further insights, we see that the  

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.720
error is coming from the sketch.js file from 
line 10. If we switch back to our code and see  

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.200
in line 10, we have written the "background" 
command in a wrong way. If i add the D again,  

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.240
the error message disappears. Sometimes you will 
come up with errors that you might not know how  

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.160
to solve. A very good way to solve a problem, is 
to first google it. So copy the complete error  

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.800
message and just paste it in google or another 
search engine and see what's coming up. There's  

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.200
a lot of different platforms on the web, where 
people post the errors and other people reply to  

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.640
those errors. And it's very likely, that the error 
you came up with, already somebody else solved  

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.680
this. So try to google or search for your error 
and see if somebody else has a solution for this.  

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.240
But we can use the console tool for much 
more. For example if you have a really long  

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.920
and complex code written, sometimes it's good 
to figure out where your code stops working.  

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.080
To do this, you can simply add comments to your 
code that are output into the console. To do this,  

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.640
there is a simple command called "console.log()". 
And then inside the brackets we can now define  

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.840
something that is output to the console. 
For example we say here "draw complete".

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.360
And i save this and now i can see here that 
this text, this string, that i sent to the  

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.440
"console.log" command, is now being output in 
the "console". So we know our draw function works  

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.400
until the end. And if there would be an error 
before it wouldn't output the "draw complete".  

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.080
Because the draw is a loop that is running 
over and over again we can see here the  

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.040
the numbers in front are telling us that the same 
string is output multiple times and for example  

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:59.840
if we do the same in our setup function add a 
"console.log()" here and say "setup complete".

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.480
This should only come up once, because setup 
is only run once in the beginning and we can  

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.080
see here "setup complete" is called once and 
then "draw complete" is called multiple times.  

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.680
You can also see a little 
warning here. In this case  

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.280
JavaScript or the HTML in the browser is looking 
for a certain file that it couldn't find,  

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.840
but it's just a warning so it's nothing 
serious and you can ignore this for now.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.960
you
