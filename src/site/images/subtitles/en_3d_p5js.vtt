In the next part of this lecture, i will introduce 
you to a system that will allow you to create  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
3D objects through code. That are constructed 
in a way so that you can use them in fabrication  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.760
processes like 3D printing. But you 
can also create 3D objects in p5.js.  

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.920
But they are only meant for the visual output 
of 3D objects, like you can see here in this  

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.360
animation. And they're not meant to be used 
as an export for 3D printing for example.  

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.160
I will now quickly guide you through an example, 
for how to build 3D objects using p5.js.  

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.240
But we'll not go into depth as this 
is not the focus of this lecture.  

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.320
We already know the p5.js standard renderer, which 
generates pixel data and the SVG vector renderer.  

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.480
If we want to generate 3D objects, we need to 
use the WEBGL renderer. We need to add WEBGL to  

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.200
our createCanvas command. This will allow us 
to use the WEBGL capabilities of our browser  

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.520
and thereby the performance of the rendering is 
increased, as the browser is using your graphics  

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.080
card to render these 3D objects more quickly. As 
soon as we add WEBGL to the create canvasCommand,  

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.800
we can now make use of all the fancy 3D commands 
that are built into p5.js. If you're interested  

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.440
in creating more visually interesting objects, 
that are for example, have reflections like this  

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.080
example up here, then you need to think about the 
lighting of your 3D scene. And there are different  

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.840
commands that allow you to set up different kinds 
of lights from ambient lights that come from every  

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.680
direction to point lights that allow you to create 
different spots and thereby also nice reflections.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.400
As we are now in the 3d space all our 
transformations also work in 3D. Translate,  

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.760
rotate now have an additional dimension, 
how we can translate and transform things.  

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.400
From rotate we now have rotateX, rotateY and 
rotateZ, to also rotate in different directions.  

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.240
If we want really nice 3d materials and you will 
probably know this from other 3d applications,  

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.800
where you need materials/textures to create 
good renderings for 3D objects, we cannot use  

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.080
only the fill color, because if you use only fill,  

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.200
it will just be plain red, without any 
kind of reflections or shadows or anything.  

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.800
There are different kinds of materials already 
provided by p5.js, like this specularMaterial,  

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.360
that i've used here. And also our vertex commands 
that we can use to create more complex shapes, we  

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.400
can now also use in the third dimension. And this 
is just a simple square, that i've added here, but  

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.560
obviously you could use all three dimensions and 
create really complex 3D shapes and structures.  

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.960
So this is just a really really small 
example, trying to give you a first  

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.160
introduction to building 3D objects in p5.js. I 
will put a few more links to special functions  

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:38.400
below this video so you can explore the reference 
regarding 3D objects in p5.js a little bit more.
