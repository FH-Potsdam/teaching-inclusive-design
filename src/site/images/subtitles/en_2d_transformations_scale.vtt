00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.000
We already used the translate and rotate 
function to manipulate our coordinate system.  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.200
There's one last transformation that i want to 
introduce you to. And this is the scale function.  

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.920
The scale function is quite simple. It simply 
changes the size of your object. So it scales  

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.280
everything that you draw. For example if i enter 
a 2 here everything is multiplied by 2. But this  

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.480
also means that your whole coordinate system 
is multiplied. So it's the x and y coordinates,  

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.880
it's the size of objects, everything is 
scaled times 2. Of course we can add other  

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.640
numbers. Times 10 or we can also decrease 
the size of our objects 0.5, for example, is  

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.320
the half of everything. And we can make it even 
smaller say only a fourth. So you can use this  

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.200
to change the size of objects, but you have to 
keep in mind that everything is changing. Again  

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:11.840
you can also use the push and the pop function 
to store a certain state and return to this.
