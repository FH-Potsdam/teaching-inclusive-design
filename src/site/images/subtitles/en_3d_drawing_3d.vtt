00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.560
Besides the 2D objects we can also generate 
3d objects. I've used the same boilerplate as  

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.720
before. We have an objects array here and let's 
start with the cube. Generate a variable to store  

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.800
our cube object inside. The cube command/function 
also takes an object with parameters. Again we can  

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.640
define a center. I will leave this now at the 
default value. And then we can define the size  

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.840
of our cube. Then of course we need 
to push it into our objects array.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:54.480
And now we have a cube that we can further 
work with. The next object is the sphere.  

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
Again a variable and then the sphere 
command. This one takes also an object  

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.720
and i will simply copy the parameters from 
before, so this time we will move the object  

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.840
a little bit to the side, so that they don't 
overlap and in this case it's a radius not size.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.680
And if i save this,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.760
oh, of course i need to add it to our 
objects array, otherwise it's not rendered.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.160
We get our sphere and similar to the circle we had 
before, we can also define segments if we want.  

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.080
Let's use a very low number of segments 
to really see the difference here.  

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.640
And now we can see a lot less smooth circular 
sphere-ish surface here. And the last object  

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.280
i want to show you, there are actually a lot 
more objects that you can generate a lot more 3d  

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.640
primitives, i've added a list of other primitives 
below this video with links to the reference where  

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.000
you can see how they are generated. So the 
last one i want to show you is the cylinder.  

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.560
I will just abbreviate this here. And the 
cylinder function, this one also takes an object  

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.760
and i will copy this from our sphere. 
This time we move it to the other side.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.920
And the cylinder also has a 
radius and in addition a height.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.200
And let's increase the segments for our 
cylinder and of course we need to push it  

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.480
into our objects array.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.040
Save it and now we also have a cylinder.
