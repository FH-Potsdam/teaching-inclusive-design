00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.360
The most important software we will 
use in this seminar is a code editor.  

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.680
You can use any code editor you want. I recommend 
visual studio code. It's a free software from  

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.760
Microsoft, that you can use to edit code. The 
most important bit is that you use an actual  

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.520
code editor. Code editors are slightly 
different to other text editing software.  

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.800
If you're using a code editor 
and you open a text file,  

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.960
you see the raw text information of that specific 
file and this is very different to how other word  

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.480
processors are working. If we switch for example 
to a software that allows you to format text. And  

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.680
in this case we have just a small bit of text and 
i chose one word that i made bold and cursive.  

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.880
If i save this now as a DOCX file for example. 
The the standard Microsoft word format.  

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.920
Then it does not only save our text here, but 
it creates a document that also stores all the  

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.320
information about the formatting in a markup 
document. And if we want to inspect this. I've  

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.600
already prepared this here. This is the DOCX file. 
The DOCX file is actually not a text document.  

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.960
It's a zip file, which contains a lot of other 
documents. So if i just rename a DOCX file to ZIP  

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.920
and unzip it. I see that there are multiple 
folders and documents inside this folder  

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.080
and the word document.xml file contains 
our actual information about the document.  

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.800
And i can now see here that the word "hello world" 
was now encapsulated in all this additional markup  

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.000
language. So now we see the actual raw document 
and not the formatted document as it is presented  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.120
by word or other word processors. This is 
the important difference. If you're using a  

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.360
code editor you're seeing the raw text information 
of the text file and not some formatted version  

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
that is actually being generated into 
a completely different file format.  

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.800
So whatever code editor you 
use, your are completely free,  

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.440
but you need to use a code editor to work with 
the tutorials that we are doing in this seminar.
