In this lecture we're really trying to give 
you an introduction to parametric design.  

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.760
But of course we cannot cover all the different 
features and functionalities that are out there  

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.120
for p5.js. There is a really 
great documentation online  

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.000
and the reference. Inside the reference you find 
all the different functions that are available.  

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.040
This is not only interesting if you're trying 
to go beyond what we teach you in the seminar,  

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.600
but this might also be useful if you 
forget what kind of parameters you need,  

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.120
to call a certain command. For example the "rect" 
command which we're using to draw a rectangle, you  

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.480
can see here. And for almost all of the commands, 
you find good examples inside the reference,  

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.040
so you can see how you can use the function, 
but the most important bit comes down here:  

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.080
the syntax. This shows you how you can call 
this function. It shows you what parameters  

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.720
go in this function and what types of parameters. 
In this example here, you can see that the first  

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.960
three parameters are mandatory, so you need to 
provide these parameters. The parameters in these  

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.120
brackets, those are not. These are optional. You 
don't need to provide them. And below you also  

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.160
find an explanation what these parameters are. 
The most important bit being the one in the front.  

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.600
This defines what kind of parameter this 
is. In this case it's a number parameter.  

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.360
And this is the X-coordinate of this rectangle, 
so where should it be positioned on the screen.  

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
In this reference you can really quickly 
look up the different functions and how  

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.840
you can call them and what parameters 
are required or optional to call them.
