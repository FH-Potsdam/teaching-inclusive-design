00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
One last shape that i would like 
to introduce to you, is the arc  

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.680
shape. It's just a segment of a circle, of the 
circle line that we can draw and this one is a  

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.240
little bit more complicated than the other 
ones. We have the arc command and now we have  

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.920
a couple of parameters. First of course the x 
and the y value, so where should our circle,  

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.000
the center of our circle, be located. Then we 
define the width and the height of our circle.  

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.200
Obviously you could also use different parameters 
to create an ellipse instead of a circle.  

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.200
And now it gets interesting, because now we need 
to define what the start and the end angle is of  

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.920
the line that we want to draw. There's two ways 
of defining this so the default values of defining  

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.960
angles in p5.js is radians and radians is also 
the default value for most other applications.  

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:15.200
To do this, we have a little helper Math.PI, this 
holds the PI value and 2 times PI is 360 degrees,  

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.680
so one full circle, so one PI is 180 degrees. To 
convert this into degrees, we can simply divide  

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.280
it by 180 and multiply it by the angle that we 
want as an outcome. This is now the start angle  

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.000
and now we need the end angle, so we make 
it 180 so we have 90 degrees, a quarter  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.240
circle. And if i save this now, we have a 
quarter circle and what you will notice is,  

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.600
most people think that zero degrees is at the top, 
but it's actually not at the top but it is at the  

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.280
right side, so if i change this to zero you will 
see that the circle actually starts on the right.  

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.920
okay. so in p5.js we have an option to 
switch from radians to degrees to make  

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.200
it a little bit easier and we have to write 
less code which is nice. For this there is the  

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
angleMode command and here we can 
say we want to work in DEGREES

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:28.480
And now if i would save it, now it would look not 
right, so what we can do now is we can change,  

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.840
we can remove the first bit and just use angle 
in degrees directly. Now we have the same  

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.920
arc again. And there is one last option. An 
optional one, by default the arc function  

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.200
uses an open arc. The end and start point are 
not connected. There are two different ways of  

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.440
doing this. There's a PIE version which creates 
a pie chart. If i change the second angle to 90  

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.640
we can now see that we have kind of a pie chart 
and we now could do multiple PI elements and  

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:19.440
arcs and create a pie chart from it. There's 
also a last one which is called the CHORD

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.040
And here what simply is happening, 
the start and the end point are simply  

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
being connected. That's it. If i 
change for example the 90 to 270  

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.160
we can see that now the upper and 
the right corner are being connected
