00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.680
So far we have been defining all our variables 
manually in the code. Like here we have the radius  

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.520
variable that we define here to be 100 and then 
we use it in the code. But as we are generating  

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.960
more complex layouts, it's interesting to use 
input to change certain parameters as the code  

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.800
is already running. You can use this, to create 
different variations, test out different inputs,  

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.400
to change the layout and the design and thereby 
inspect what might be the optimal input here.  

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.720
To do this, we can use a couple of 
different input methods. The first one,  

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.080
that i'm going to show you are input fields. 
These are basically HTML input forms, that we  

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.480
can access to get certain parameters. Let's start 
with with the most simple one, the text input.  

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.480
This is simply a text field, where you can enter 
a text or number and then you can use the input as  

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.880
the code is running to change the layout. For our 
input fields we first need to create a variable,  

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.920
ideally in the "global scope". Let's call our 
variable textInput and then in the setup function,  

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.840
we can now actually create our input field 
and we will store it in our variable.  

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.800
The function name is simply createInput. In 
the brackets, we can define the default value.  

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.840
Let's now say this is 100. And then we can 
also define where this should be positioned.  

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.040
And i will just place it below our sketch and we 
can also tell the system how big this should be.  

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.280
I will just say 50 pixels. And now we can 
get the current value of our input field. We  

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.120
can use it here, through the value command. It 
simply uses the textInput again. The textInput  

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.080
on the "global scope" is used to reference our 
input field. We just use the value command and  

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:21.840
now get the current value inside our text field. 
i save this and now as i change this. Immediately

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.200
the code applies this new input 
and changes the size of our circle.
