We can also import our p5.js vector graphics, 
the SVG file, into fusion 360. To go a little bit  

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.800
further, in this example, we will create a little 
cube and then we will use our SVG vector paths, to  

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.840
cut holes into our little cube object. Let's start 
by adding a simple plain little rectangle here.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.840
Finish the sketch.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.000
And now extrude.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.200
And now we start the actual import. Therefore, 
we use the insert. Then we select "insert  

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:10.800
SVG", "from my computer" in this 
case and select the curves.svg.  

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.800
We want to place it on top of our rectangle here.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.600
Position it, scale it, so that it fits on our 
rectangle, on our cube here. Finish the sketch.  

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.800
And now we can simply select all the individual 
paths, the polygons, that we created in p5.js.  

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.200
And, for example, we could now use the extrude 
function again. We could create an extrusion up,  

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.680
so that we could use it for example in a 3D 
printer or we could go the other way and create  

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:07.840
a cut into our object. And then for example use a 
CNC mill to cut into a wooden block or something.  

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:21.840
Again another way of using our vector graphics 
in a 3D software to generate 3D bodies.
