In the last two videos, i showed you how to 
create 2D and 3D shapes in JSCAD. These shapes  

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.040
we can also colorize, but it's very important 
to have in mind, as we export them later on,  

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.680
for example in the STL format, we lose all the 
color information. The colors are more to help  

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.840
us during the development process, for example 
to differentiate between different objects.  

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.720
To colorize an object, we have the colorize 
function. And the colorize function takes an array  

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:47.200
of three numbers, from zero to one. Different from 
p5.js 0 to 255. To get a red cube, we write one,  

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.840
zero, zero. We could add a fourth number 
to add a transparency. Also zero to one.  

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.640
And then as a second parameter, after the array, 
we provide the object that we want to colorize. In  

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.840
our instance the cube object. And this is now very 
different to p5.js. In p5.js we defined the color  

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.560
and everything we drew afterwards, was colorized 
in this color that we defined. Here every time we  

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.920
use any kind of transformation function: colorize, 
translate, rotate, a new object is created  

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.720
and returned. For the colorize function, a new 
object of the colorized object is created for us.  

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.240
We can store this in another object. Let's call 
it color object and return this color object.  

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.120
In the beginning, this might be weird, that 
there's always a new object being created,  

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.280
but there's something really nice about 
it. Because now you can use the same cube  

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.840
object and use it in multiple transformations, 
without any need of creating a new cube object.  

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.000
So we save this and now we have a red cube.
