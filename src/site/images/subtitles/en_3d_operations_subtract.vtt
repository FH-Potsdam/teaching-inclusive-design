00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.000
In the last video we used 
the union function to combine  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
multiple cubes. We're now going to use 
the subtract function, to subtract an  

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.680
additional object from our union 
object. So let's create a sphere.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.000
Radius 25 and we will move it slightly around.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.840
And for inspection, we push 
it into our objects array.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.080
Save it and now we have a little sphere connecting 
to our union object. And we now want to subtract  

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.800
it from the union object. We want to cut something 
out of the union object. Therefore, we don't push  

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.320
the union object and we don't push our sphere, but 
we create a new variable to store our subtracted  

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.160
object. Let's call it subObject and we will use 
the subtract function. And also the subtract  

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.600
function also only takes an array. But the 
order in which we provide the parameters is very  

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.120
important. Because the first object is the object 
that we will subtract all the other objects from.  

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.920
So in this case, we will start with our union 
object and we will subtract the sphere object.  

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.120
Then we push the result into our objects array.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.240
Save it and now we can see that the sphere has 
been subtracted from our union shape. And just to  

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.040
show you the importance of the order of elements 
in the subtract array. I will just switch them  

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:17.600
around and now we can see that this time the 
union object was subtracted from the sphere.
