This is the companion website for the "Parametric Design" course at the [Design department](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/design/) at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam ([FHP](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/)). This website provides a gentle introduction to code-driven design for beginners. Only using free open source technologies. The full course is designed to be taught through a mix of online videos and group activities. But the website 
itself should serve as a good starting point for your code-driven design journey.

The course targets all designers or creative minds, that want to explore how to design digital and physical artifacts through code. At FHP we offer Interface, Product and Communication Design, which will play a central role in this course.

## What is this course about?

What makes this course different from other coding classes? This course has a strong focus on the interfaces between the output we generate through code and the possibilities to use this output in various fabrication or design applications (see overview below). We will use JavaScript for the whole course, as its a good language to start with. You will need no prior knowledge of coding. If you want to become a developer or computer scientics, this course might be a gentle introduction, but probably not what you are looking for. For creatives to get into coding, an important part is learning how to transfer ideas into code. In this course we primarily do this through group activities and discussions. This website will provide some excercises to get you started, but the most important part is to keep experimenting and playing with code, until it feels more natural.

## Thank You!

I have never studied computer sciences (even though i have a CS PhD now). More than two decades ago the internet thought my teenage self how to code (particularly [SELFHTML](https://wiki.selfhtml.org)). So i am very grateful for all the great open educational resources out there. More recently i have been particularly been inspired to work on OERs by the works of [Tamara Munzner (Data Vis)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/) and [Daniel Shiffman (Creative Coding)](https://shiffman.net/). Thank you all open source and open educational resource contributors!!!
